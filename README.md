### Hi,
I'm Luke, a Full Stack Engineer and Developer Lead working at Holiday Extras.

The thing I most enjoy about being an Engineer is building tools and processes to support other Engineers. It's what led me to be a Developer Lead and what drives the decisions I make as an Engineer on a daily basis. I advocate for things like strong typing and TDD as I believe in the value that these ideas add to the daily lives of Engineers.

#### I'm currently working on:
- developing a new product for HX - building an interface between their React Single Page App and backend systems using microservices and GraphQL.

#### Some previous projects of note:
- Engineering Values - not an engineering project, but a list of values, demonstrable actions and their impact for Engineers at Holiday Extras
- [Two Wheeled Adventure Tours](https://twowheeledadventuretours.com/) - a blog and touring company focussed on motorcycle touring
- [WinDiary](https://windiary.app/) - a journal for tracking positivity I built to aid people's mental health

#### I'm currently learning:
- Python 3 (and isometric game development)
